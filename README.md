# Password-Generator


This project is a simple yet robust password generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to customize their passwords by specifying length and including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  The generated password's strength is also visually indicated.


## Features and Functionality

* **Customizable Password Length:**  Users can adjust the password length using a slider (1-20 characters).
* **Character Type Selection:** Users can choose to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or symbols in their passwords.  A minimum of one character type must be selected.
* **Password Strength Indicator:** The generated password's strength is visually represented using a color-coded alert (red: weak, yellow: medium, green: strong).  Strength is determined by length and character type diversity.
* **Copy to Clipboard:** A button allows users to easily copy the generated password to their clipboard.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and function well on various screen sizes.
